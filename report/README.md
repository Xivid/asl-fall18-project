Sections 7.2 and 7.3 are finished in a rush and correctness is not guaranteed. A known issue is that the way to calculate the service rate $\mu$ in 7.2 is wrong, it should be measured in the middleware.

All other sections received full marks, but nothing can be guaranteed either, as different systems can have very different behaviours and underlying reasons.
