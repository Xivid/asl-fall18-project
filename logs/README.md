# Experiment Logs

## Experiment data

This folder stores all the log files generated in experiment running, including memtier logs, middleware logs, ping and dstat logs.

- Section 1: TBA

All directory structures are organised by the following way: [{workload}/]vc{number of virtual clients per thread}[/w{number of worker threads per middleware}]/r{number of repetition}. ([] means optional)

## Logs of scripts

The experiments were run in several batches. The log files of batch scripts generated by all machines are put under this directory. If a batch script calls another script which runs the experiments actually, the log of that script is put into the folder of the corresponding section as described above.

## Naming of virtual machines

vm1~3: memtier machines (clients are named by 10, 11, 20, 21, 30, 31)
vm4~5: middleware machines (middlewares are named by 00, 01)
vm6~8: memcached machines
